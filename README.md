# Validation-a-Finite-State-Model-for-Transit-Electrification-Simulation-Software
Electrification of bus is one the most expensive project
in Montreal and Government is trying to find the lease expensive
solution for that. This project is going to explain the software
which is used for that and then check specification of the main
algorithm for that. Here we used NUSMV and UPPAl.
